# Using the Skeleton

You are now done with most of your yak shaving. Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
1. Rename (move) the NAME directory and NAME.rb file to be the name of your project.
1. Edit your NAME.gemspec file to have all the information for your project.
1. Rename test/test_NAME.rb to also have your project name.
1. Start coding.
